# iDE OS
Standing on the shoulders of giants

## Vision

Doing your work in the shell puts you closer to the computer giving you a better learning experience and ultimately leveraging its full potential.

Building your own IDE in the shell takes quite a bit of investment, the return is you end up with your own IDE tailored to your needs.

The problem is once you've built your custom IDE how do you install and manage it on other machines?

The goal of IDEOS is to give you the ultimate shell IDE which is also easy to install, highly configurable, and easy to maintain - it should basically be awesome and get out of your way so you can build other awesome things.
